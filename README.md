# flare
Flare is an application development framework for writing software frontends in pure Python.

## About
*flare* is an app development framework for Python-based web-apps running on top of [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) in the browser.

It has integrations to concepts with [ViUR](https://www.viur.dev/), an MVC-framework for the Google App Engine platform, but can also be used stand-alone.

## History
*flare* is the result of a several years experience in writing web-apps in pure Python. Formerly compiled from Python into JavaScript using PyJS, it now entirely settles up on Pyodide. Additionally, *flare* serves as a toolbox for various projects and solutions developed at [Mausbrand Informationssysteme GmbH](https://www.mausbrand.de/en). 

## Pyodide
*flare* is designed to be used with [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide).

Pyodide is described as "The Python scientific stack, compiled to WebAssembly". Precisely speaking, Pyodide is the Python reference implementation ([cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython/)) that is compiled using [emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten) and runs natively inside modern browsers as WebAssembly (WASM).

Pyodide combines this WASM-compiled Python interpreter with well-known, natively compiled Python-libraries, mostly used in scientific computing. Pure Python packages can also be integrated using the tool `micropip`, which is served together with Pyodide.

In combination with *flare*, we use Pyodide to quickly build modern web-apps entirely in pure Python.
