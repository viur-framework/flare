Flare is an application development framework for writing software frontends in pure Python.

## About
Flare is an app development framework for Python-based web-apps running on top of [Pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide) in the browser.

It has integrations to concepts with [ViUR](https://www.viur.dev/), an MVC-framework for the Google App Engine platform, but can also be used stand-alone.

Fire up the tiny [Hello World](https://raw.githack.com/viur-framework/flare/main/hello.html) live demo. More information can be found [in the documentation](https://viur-flare.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## History
Flare is the result of a several years experience in writing web-apps in pure Python. Formerly compiled from Python to JavaScript using [PyJS](https://github.com/pyjs/pyjs), it now entirely settles up on Pyodide. Additionally, Flare serves as a toolbox for various projects and solutions developed at [Mausbrand Informationssysteme GmbH](https://www.mausbrand.de/en), a software-company from Dortmund, Germany.

## Pyodide
Pyodide is the [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython/) reference implementation that is compiled using [emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten) and runs natively inside modern browsers as WebAssembly (WASM). Pyodide itself comes with the full Python scientific-stack.

For better load-time optimization, we started to maintain our own fork of Pyodide called [pyodide-nano](https://github.com/mausbrand/pyodide).

## Related projects
- [html5](https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-html5) became an integrated part of Flare, but also exists stand-alone as a HTML5-DOM-object library. It is the core component of Flare and provides an HTML-parser for rapid DOM prototyping.
- [pyodide-html](https://github.com/xhlulu/pyodide-html) is another HTML object library for Pyodide which can be directly installed from within Pyodide.
